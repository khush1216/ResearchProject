INITIAL COMMITS - App for Collection of Data. 
Code for collection: MovementService.java, MainActivity.java

RECENT COMMITS:
Activity Recognition Methods tried:
1. Change the number of features (smoothened magnitude values) to be passed to FFT. Tried with 32,64,128,256.
Best results by 64. Accuracy for 4 classes - Walking, Running, Cycling, Still = 96%. 
With Walking , Running, Still. Accuracy obtained by Random Forests was 100%. Tested for overfitting. 
2. Changed the features itself. Sent max magnitude amongst smoothened readings, top 8-32 peaks and time between peaks to the FFT.
Observed accuracy reduced than the previously observed one. Best result by Logistic Regression for 3 classes - 86%, for 4 classes 80%

Working prototype: Predicts accurately for 3-4 classes with initial classifier. - code found in ServiceSensor.java, MapsActivity.java
Current Work: Ongoing realtime testing on second classifier - (with peaks and time between peaks). - code found in ServiceSensorPeaks.java, MapsActivity.java
